### Introduction
King is a open-source, new and work-in-progress programming language made entirely in Python. It is heavily inspired by BASIC and Python for some of his functions. The language was born in 08/04/2021

Its extension is .king and the code is excecuted from the Batch file (for Windows) or from the Shell file (for Linux). If you want to make custom King file and excecute it, all you have to do is to edit this two files with the name of the newly created file.

To find all the commands or more infos about King, they're in the Official [Wiki](https://github.com/King-Night-cyber/King-Programming-Language/wiki)

### Technologies
The project is made with:
* Python 3.5 or above

### How to Run
To run this project, either run the .bat or the .sh file or type in the terminal:

```
python main.py [filname].king
```

NOTE: if you use the Batch/Shell file to execute the code, make sure the name of the file are the same otherwise it won't work.

NOTE++: if you have any problems with some errors about packets not installed, just run the ` install_req.bat ` or the ` install_req.sh `. It will automatically install all the things needed.

### Project Status
The current King version is 0.1.0. The code is supported and updated by [King-Night-cyber](#https://github.com/King-Night-cyber).

Little code snipped completely written in King

### Future Ideas
* In the future, I'd like to rewrite everything with C, since it's definetly faster than Python. I am using it since it's easier and it wont matter how fast it is (for now...)
* More functions
* Self building, meaning that I can continue developing the language using itself
